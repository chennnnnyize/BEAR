# BEAR
**Physics-Principled Building Environment for Control and Reinforcement Learning**

Thank you for choosing BEAR.

BEAR is a physics based Building Environment for Control and Reinforcement Learning. The platform allows researchers to benchmark both model-based and model-free controllers using a broad collection of standard building models in Python without co-simulation with other building simulators. For implementation convenience, only three elements (building type, weather type, and city) need to be selected by user to create an environment.

The main functionalities of **BEAR** are the following :
